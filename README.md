User gets 9 tries to guess a random four digit number generated by a method.  To play please enter a unique 4 digit number between 1 and 8 with spaces!

If the user digit is the same as the computer generated one and at the same position in the array, a clue of 2 is printed on the side, if the position is incorrect but the number correct, clue 1 is printed on the side.  IF the nmber is wrong, 0 is printed
